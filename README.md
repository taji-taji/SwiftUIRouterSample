## Router for SwiftUI Sample

Sample implementation of Router in a multi-module configuration project in SwiftUI.

- Manage all screen transitions in your app using NavigationStack and NavigationPath
- Eliminate dependencies between feature modules
  - Each screen does not need to know the concrete type of the View to which it is transitioning
- Screen transitions can be DI'd in the preview of each screen
